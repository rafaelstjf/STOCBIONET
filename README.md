# Stochastic simulation algorithms

[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

Stochastic simulation algorithms for Gene Regulatory Networks for delayed and non-delayed reactions.

Avaiable methods:

 * Direct method
 * First reaction method
 * First reaction method using dependency graph
 
Methods in development:
 
 * Next reaction method Classic (__95%__ )
 * Next reaction method Simplified (__95%__ )
 * Modified next reaction method (__0%__ )
 * Rejection method (__0%__ )
 * Delayed modified next reaction method (__0%__ )

Requirements:

 * C++11

Example of input file:
```sh
#reaction rate constants

t2=10;
t3=40;
v1=10;
#specie quantities
A=1;
B=1;
C=1;
D=1;
E=1;
F=1;
G=1;
#reactions
transcription,k1:A + B -> C;
